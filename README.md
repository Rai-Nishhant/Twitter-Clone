# Backend
Created Schema for databases.
Created API's and Routes for functionality like-
-> New User Creation
-> Login Authentication (Used JWT tokens)
-> Creating/Deleting a Tweet
-> Like/Unlike a Tweet
-> Bookmark a tweet
-> Checking Followers/Following

Currently implementing other API's like getting the tweets on the home page based on following and random. 
Working on Integrating everything and hosting the complete project with all sort of functionalities online.

Do suggest any upgradations.
